Module 0: Course introduction
========================

## Practice Lab - Validate lab environment 

--------

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “alias”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

Lab Specification Guide
-----------------------

The MB-800 course provides a set of lab instructions hosted publicly on GitHub.
These labs align with the content of certain modules within the course. In
addition to the recommended schedule in this guide, you will find placeholder
slides in the Instructor PowerPoint decks for each lab. Based on timing
necessities or your own teaching preferences, you may choose to move these
slides to different parts of the course and teach the labs at different points.
