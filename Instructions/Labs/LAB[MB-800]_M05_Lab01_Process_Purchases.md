## Exercise 1: Process a purchase from order to invoice and review the posted documents

### Scenario

As the purchasing agent you are replenishing the stock for the European
warehouse. The computer monitors are currently low on stock and a purchase order
with their main vendor Cronus Cardoxy Sales is placed on January 14th, 2021. It
was agreed to always invoice in USD instead of their currency (DKK) and a
purchase request is sent to the correct order address for the following items to
be delivered on January 19th, 2021:

-   100 pieces of the 15” flat panel at \$ 4,999.89 a box, containing 10 pieces.

-   50 pieces of the 17” monitor at \$ 5,348.56 a box, containing 10 pieces

The purchase request is confirmed by the vendor on January 15th, 2021 with order
confirmation OC15-479. They mention a delivery delay of a couple of days,
expecting to be able to deliver the entire order on January 22nd, 2021.

Eventually the goods are delivered with delivery note DN01-47 on January 23rd,
2021 as follows:

-   11 boxes of the 15” flat panel – this is 1 box more than ordered

-   4 boxes of the 17” monitor – this is 1 box less than ordered

The purchase invoice with number 20-0747 is received by mail on January 26th,
2021 where a 5% discount is granted on the 15” monitors as a compensation for
the delivery delay. The invoice needs to be paid within 30 days.
