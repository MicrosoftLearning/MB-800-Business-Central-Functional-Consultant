## Exercise 1: Complete the customer card

### Scenario

As the functional consultant, you are collecting more information about the
sales process, and more particularly about the customers who are buying your
products and the conditions surrounding delivery.

In order to deliver the computer hardware items from the European warehouse to
the European customers, Contoso uses DHL as a shipping agent. Web shop customers
who are end-users will have the option to choose between home delivery or
delivery at a pick-up point.

The following different pick-up points are set up as shipping addresses on the
webshop customer (CWEB0001):

-   PICK-UP DK: Carl Blochs Gade 7, DK-8000 Arhus C – contact: Hr. Jonathan
    Mollerup

-   PICK-UP BE: Binkkampen 33, BE-1020 BRUSSEL – contact: Dhr. Luc van Vugt

-   PICK-UP FR: 34 Avenue Parmentier, FR-75000 PARIS – contact: M. Jean E.
    TRENARY

Since this is a generic customer, different orders are never combined into one
shipment. It is however possible that one order needs to be shipped parts
because of item availability. This should be under rare circumstances, since
Contoso has stated to his customers to guarantee a maximum delivery time within
2 days, which is compliant with DHL’s standard shipping service and time.

In the domestic areas sales activities are performed by sales representatives
who each have their set of customers. All transactions need to be assigned to a
specific sales person as follows:

-   C00010 Spotsmeyer’s Furnishings is a customer from Annette Hill

-   C00020 Progressive Home Furnishings is a customer from John Roberts

-   C00030 New Concepts Furniture is a customer from Peter Saddow

Also don’t forget to assign the SALESPERSON dimension to each sales person.

## Exercise 2: Configure sales pricing and discounts

### Scenario

The sales manager at Contoso, has determined the following rules regarding their
sales of computer hardware:

-   All sales prices are set in local currency, thus USD.

-   For each item a general sales price for all EU customers is determined for
    the base unit of measure. However, when large amounts are ordered, a lower
    unit price is granted.

    -   The 15” flat panel is sold at \$ 499.95 a piece. However, if the
        customer orders a box of 10 pieces, the price is lowered to \$ 4,800.00
        for the entire box.

    -   The 17” monitor is sold at \$ 700.00 a piece, However, if the customer
        orders a box of 10 pieces, the price is lowered to \$ 6,550.00 for the
        entire box.

    -   For other customers (both domestic and non-EU) separate sales prices
        will be determined later.

-   Depending on the customer group (small, medium, large) and item group
    (computer, monitor, accessories) a discount percentage is granted to achieve
    the net sales price.

    -   The generic web shop customer and all other small businesses receive a
        standard 3% on all monitors. Medium sized customers receive 6% and large
        companies receive 10% on the same items.

-   To boost web shop sales, a discount of 5% is granted on the total amount of
    the order for sales above \$50.00 .

You have to set up this sales price structure as provided by Contoso.
