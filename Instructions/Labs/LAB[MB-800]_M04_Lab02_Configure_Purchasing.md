Hands-on-Lab 4.2: Configure Purchasing
======================================

Exercise 1: Complete the vendor card
------------------------------------

### Scenario

As the functional consultant, you are collecting more information about the
purchase process, and more particularly about the vendors who you are purchasing
from and the conditions surrounding ordering and delivering of the purchased
items.

In order to supply the brand-new European warehouse and to deliver the computer
hardware items to the European customers, these items are purchased from
European wholesalers. Some of these vendors have different sales points
throughout the country.

Vendor Robert Townes is Contoso’s main supplier for all computer hardware items.
They have different locations from where to order:

-   Computers and monitors need to be ordered at the following location:

    Nyborgvej 566, DK-5000 ODENSE C – contact: Hr. Allan Vinther-Wahl

-   Other computer accessories are sold from another location:

    Havnevej 6, DK-4600 KOGE – contact: Fr. Karen Friske

Robert Townes guarantees to deliver all goods within 5 days, according to the
‘cost and freight’ shipment method.

special items may take a bit longer and have a deviating delivery time. For

Exercise 3: Set up an item vendor catalog
-----------------------------------------

### Scenario

Although Robert Townes is considered the main supplier for all computer hardware
items, these products can also be purchased with other vendors. For example,
when the item is temporarily out of stock.

When replenishing the item, Contoso will use the requisition worksheet, where
the main supplier will be suggested. However, it must be possible to order from
other available suppliers as well. Purchase orders will be sent to the vendors,
based on the vendors item numbers.

You will set up an item vendor catalog for all computer hardware items, as
follows:

-   All items can be purchased with vendor Robert Townes (V9002).

-   All monitors can be purchased with vendor School of Fine Art (V9005) and can
    be provided within 2 days:

    -   PLM-345 = 15" 1501 FP Flat Panel

    -   PLM-346 = 17" M780 Monitor

-   All accessories can be purchased with vendor Meagan Bond (V9006) and can be
    provided within 10 days:

    -   WMSA-10035 = Advanced Mouse

    -   WMSA-10036 = Quietkey keyboard

    -   WMSA-10037 = Speakers

*Remark: For exercise purposes, only set up the catalog for the monitors.*

Exercise 4: Configure recurring purchase lines
----------------------------------------------

### Scenario

Next to the suppliers of trading goods, Contoso also has a numerous amount of
other costs. Often on a monthly recurring basis, the same purchase invoices need
to be processed.

To reduce the processing time, you explain the configuration of ‘recurring
purchase lines’ and together with the accounting manager, you set up the
following example:

Contoso has to pay a ‘health& dental insurance’ for each employee at the
company. They receive a monthly invoice with a fixed amount. These costs need to
be processed per department, as follows:

-   The total amount of the invoice is CAD 1,200.00, which is processed on the
    610000 income statement account.

-   25% of the cost is for the sales department.

-   35% of the cost is for the administration department.

-   40% of the cost is for the production department.

You need to set up the recurring purchase lines for vendor Alpine Ski House
(V9007), so that these lines are automatically filled in when creating a new
purchase invoice.
