## Exercise 1: Setting up a purchase approval workflow

### Scenario

*Remark: You must make sure that at least three users exist in Business
Central.*

-   *User 1 = Accounting manager (take your own account for this role)*

-   *User 2 = Purchase manager (take the account from one of the fellow students
    for this role)*

-   *User 3 = Purchasing agent (take the account from one of the fellow students
    for this role)*

Contoso would like to start using an approval workflow for purchase orders
processed by the purchasing agent. Hereby the following requirements need to be
met:

-   The purchase orders, placed with a vendor located in Europe and processed by
    the purchasing agent, cannot be approved until multiple users, setup in a
    hierarchy, have approved the order.

    -   The purchasing agent is allowed to autonomously process orders up to
        \$5,000.00. All purchase orders up to \$10,000.00 are reviewed and
        approved by the purchasing manager. For all purchase orders for a higher
        amount the approval of the accounting manager is required.

    -   The accounting manager has unlimited purchase approval and also manages
        the approval workflow by unblocking approval workflows.

-   Other purchase orders that are processed by the always need to be approved
    by the accounting manager alone, regardless of the amount.

-   All approvers receive an internal request note. Notes are immediately
    created at the moment of approval request.
