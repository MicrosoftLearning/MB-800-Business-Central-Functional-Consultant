## Exercise 1: Set up General Journals

### Scenario

Part of the implementation process is the conversion of opening balances. For
these specific transactions a separate general journal OPENING will be created.

Separate batches are set up for the entry of the opening g/l balance accounts,
the open customer ledger entries, the open vendor ledger entries and the opening
bank balance.

For customers and vendors the detailed open ledger entries will be entered using
the existing document no. given by the previous system. The total amount will be
balanced by the regular g/l accounts for accounts receivables (10400) and
accounts payable (20100).

You also want to avoid any tax postings while entering the opening g/l balances.
