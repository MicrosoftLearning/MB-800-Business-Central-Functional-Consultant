## Exercise 1: Configure the Sales & Receivables Setup

### Scenario

Concerning the processing of sales transactions, Contoso’s account manager has
expressed the following requirements:

-   Web shop customers will be numbered separately from other customers. Regular
    customers are numbered C00010 and incremented by 10. Web shop customers are
    numbered CWEB00010 and also incremented by 10.

    *(Remark: The number series for regular customers is already created (CUST)
    and assigned in the Sales & Receivables Setup)*

-   Posted sales invoices are numbered based on the year and month in which they
    are posted. The first sales invoice, as of January 1st 2021, will be posted
    with the number S21/01/0001. The next month will be S21/02/0001 and so on.

-   A separate g/l account 40300 is setup to record invoice discounts only that
    were given to the customer. Line discounts are also given, but considered as
    part of the net sales price and thus not posted separately from the normal
    sales account.

-   Contoso works with a credit insurer, who provides credit limits for each
    customer. When this limit is reached, sales people have to communicate with
    the finance department before going ahead with the sale.

## Exercise 2: Create and configure customers

### Scenario

Based on the chart of accounts, you will set up the different customer posting
groups. With their fast-growing business abroad, they want to keep track of
their accounts receivables in the US (domestic) and in other EU countries
(foreign) separately. A third group will be set up to register transactions with
EU third-party alliances (intercompany) they have set up to expand their
business even further.

The DOMESTIC customer posting group is already set up. The other customer
posting groups will be based on this group, but with different balance accounts
(10450 for foreign customers and 10475 for intercompany customers).

A generic EU web shop customer will be created for all end-user customers that
prefer not to create a Contoso customer account. Make sure to fill in the
correct posting groups and that the following requirements are met:

-   All sales documents will be mailed as a pdf-file to the customer’s default
    Email-address and the document will also be stored as a pdf-file.

-   End user customers need to pay sales invoices before delivery using a credit
    card service. Credit card payments will be posted to the g/l account 20500
    when processing the sales invoice.

-   This fictitious customer is considered to always be part of the small
    business customer group.

You need to create this customer manually.

*Remark: before starting this exercise, first disable the existing configuration
templates for customers: CUST000001 & CUST000002*
